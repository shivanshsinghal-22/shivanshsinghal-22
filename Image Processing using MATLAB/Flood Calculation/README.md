Project Title: Mississippi River Flood Analysis

Overview
The Mississippi River Flood Analysis project leverages satellite imagery and advanced segmentation models to assess water level changes during flood events. The primary objective is to accurately delineate water bodies from the surrounding terrain, enabling a precise measurement of the water-covered area. This process is crucial for quantifying the impact of floods on the Mississippi River and gaining insights into the extent of water level increase.

Methodology

#Image Segmentation
Utilizing cutting-edge segmentation models, the project initiates the separation of water bodies from the main land in satellite images. This step is pivotal in isolating the region of interest and preparing the groundwork for subsequent analysis.

Area Calculation
The segmented images are then employed to calculate the area of the water region before and after flood occurrences. By comparing these measurements, the project yields valuable data on the expansion of water coverage during flood events.

Water Level Increase
The final phase involves computing the water level increase by analyzing the disparities in the calculated water areas. This information provides a quantitative understanding of the magnitude of flooding along the Mississippi River over time.

Conclusion
The Mississippi River Flood Analysis project aims to contribute valuable insights into flood dynamics, aiding in disaster management and environmental conservation efforts. By employing state-of-the-art technologies, this project serves as a testament to the power of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing the challenges posed by natural disasters.
